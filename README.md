# ChequeOCR
ChequeOCR is an OCR-based bank cheque processing tool that extracts key cheque details like MICR codes, payee names, and amounts, and automatically stores them in an Excel file. The project is currently under development and will include automated cheque data entry using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR.
